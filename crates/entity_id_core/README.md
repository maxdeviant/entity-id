# entity_id_core

**Note:** You probably want to use the [`entity_id`](https://docs.rs/entity_id) crate directly.

## Description

This crate houses the core functionality for the [`entity_id`](https://docs.rs/entity_id) crate, sans the actual definition of the `EntityId` derive macro.

The macro itself is defined in [`entity_id_derive`](https://docs.rs/entity_id_derive).
